## Overview
The goal of this project is to allow optimization of your Stardew Valley
crop choices. Users should be able to provide information such as number
of squares available, season, and day of season, and receive the optimal crops
to choose for these squares. Optimization will select crops that have sufficient
time to grow before season end and then choose among these those which yield the most predicted gold.
